Target Groups Settings
    deregisteration_delay.timeout_seconds: 
        time the load balancer waits before deregistering a target
    slow_start.duration_seconds:
        (see next slide)
    load_balancing.algorithm.type: 
        how the load balancer selects targets when routing requests 
        such as (Round Robin, Least Outstanding Requests)
    stickiness.enabled
    stickiness.type: 
        application-based 
        duration-based cookie
    stickiness.app_cookie.cookie_name: 
        name of the application cookie
    stickiness.app_cookie.duration_seconds: 
        application-based cookie expiration

Slow Start Mode
    By default
        a target receives its full share of requests once itâ€™s registered with the target group
    Slow Start Mode 
        gives healthy targets time to warm-up 
        before the load balancer sends them a full share of requests
    The load balancer linearly increases the number of requests that it sends to the target
    A target exits Slow Start Mode when:
        The duration period elapses
        The target becomes unhealthy
    To disable, set Slow start duration value to 0


Request Routing Algorithms 
    Least Outstanding Requests
        rule
            The next instance to receive the request 
            is the instance that has the lowest number of pending/unfinished requests
        Works with Application Load Balancer and Classic Load Balancer (HTTP/HTTPS)
    Round Robin
        Equally choose the targets from the target group
        Works with Application Load Balancer and Classic Load Balancer (TCP)
    Flow Hash
        Selects a target based on the Hash of 
            protocol
            source/destination IP address
            source/destination port
            TCP sequence number
        Each TCP/UDP connection is routed to a single target for the life of the connection
        Works with Network Load Balancer
            a NLB version sticky-session
