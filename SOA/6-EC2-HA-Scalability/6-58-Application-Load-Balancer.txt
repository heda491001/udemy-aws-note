Application load balancers is Layer 7 (HTTP)

Load balancing to 
    multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
    multiple applications on the same machine (ex: containers)

Support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket 

Support redirects 
    for example : from HTTP to HTTPS

Routing tables to different target groups:
    Routing based on path in URL 
        (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
    Routing based on hostname in URL 
        (one.example.com & other.example.com)
    Routing based on Query String, Headers
        (example.com/users?id=123&order=false)

ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application
    (example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
    because it has a port mapping feature , to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS

In comparison, we’d need multiple Classic Load Balancer per application


Target Groups
    EC2 instances 
        (can be managed by an Auto Scaling Group) – HTTP
    ECS tasks 
        (managed by ECS itself) – HTTP
    Lambda functions 
        HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
    IP Addresses 
        must be private IPs
    ALB can route to multiple target groups
    Health checks are at the target group level

Good to Know
    Fixed hostname (XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
    The application servers don’t see the IP of the client directly
        IP/Port/proto of client is inserted in the header 
            IP :      X-Forwarded-For
            Port :    X-Forwarded-Port
            proto :   X-Forwarded-Proto
