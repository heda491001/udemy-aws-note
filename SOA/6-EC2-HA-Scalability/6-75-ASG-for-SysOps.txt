 --- Lifecycle Hooks ----

By default, as soon as an instance is launched in an ASG it’s in service 

You can perform extra steps before the instance goes in service 
    (Pendingstate)
    Define a script to run on the instances as they start

You can perform some actions before the instance is terminated 
    (Terminating state)
    Pause the instances before they’re terminated for troubleshooting

Use cases: 
    cleanup, log extraction, special health checks 
    Integration with EventBridge, SNS, and SQS



--- Launch Configuration vs. Launch Template ---

Both:
    ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and the other parameters that you use to launch EC2 instances (tags, EC2 user-data...)
    You can’t edit both Launch Configurations and Launch Templates

Launch Configuration (legacy):
    Must be re-created every time

Launch Template (newer):
    Can have multiple versions
    Create parameters subsets 
        (partial configuration for re-use and inheritance)
    Provision using both On-Demand and Spot instances (or a mix)
    Supports Placement Groups, Capacity Reservations, Dedicated hosts, multiple instance types
    Can use T2 unlimited burst feature
    Recommended by AWS going forward



--- SQS with ASG ---

for example:
    we have a fleet of ec2 instance ,
    polling messages from a SQS , and do some process.

in above case , we can :
    set up a cloudwatch alarm for lentgh on SQS 
        (how many messages remained in SQS now)
    then set the ASG to track on the cloudwatch alarm, to scaling in/out


--- ASG Health Checks ---
To make sure you have high availability, 
    means you have least 2 instances 
    running across 2 AZ in your ASG 
    (must configure multi-AZ ASG)

Health checks available:
    EC2 Status Checks
    ELB Health Checks
    Custom Health Checks: 
        send instance’s health to ASG using AWS CLI or AWS SDK 

ASG will launch a new instance after terminating an unhealthy one

ASG will not reboot unhealthy hosts for you

Good to know CLI:
    set-instance-health (use with Custom Health Checks)
    terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group



--- troubleshooting ASG issues ---

<number of instances> instance(s) are already running. Launching EC2 instance failed.
    The ASG has reached the limit set by Max Capacity param. 
    Update your ASG by providing a new value for the Max Capacity param.

Launching EC2 instances is failing:
    The security group does not exist. 
        SG might have been deleted
    The key pair does not exist.  
        The key pair might have been deleted

If the ASG fails to launch an instance for over 24 hours, 
    it will automatically suspend the processes 
    (administration suspension)
