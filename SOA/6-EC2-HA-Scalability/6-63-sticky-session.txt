
sticky session = Session Affinity

It is possible to implement stickiness 
    so that the same client is always redirected 
    to the same instance behind a load balancer

This works for CLB & ALB

The “cookie” used for stickiness has an expiration date you control

Use case: 
    make sure the user doesn’t lose his session data

Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances

Cookie Names
    Application-based Cookies
        Custom cookie
            Generated by the target
            Can include any custom attributes required by the application
            Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
            Don’t use AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, or AWSALBTG (reserved for use by the ELB)
        Application cookie
            Generated by the load balancer
            Cookie name is AWSALBAPP
    Duration-based Cookies
        Cookie generated by the load balancer
        Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB
