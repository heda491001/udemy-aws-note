

for example,  we have
    ELB  -->  AZ1 : node1
         └->  AZ2 : node2 node3

With Cross Zone Load Balancing:
    each load balancer instance distributes evenly
    across all registered instances in all AZ
    the example will
        node1, node2, node3, all get 33% traffic

Without Cross Zone Load Balancing:
    Requests are distributed in the instances of the
    node of the Elastic Load Balancer
    the example will
        node1 get 50% traffic
        node2 , node3 get 25% traffic

Cross-Zone Load Balancing enable
    Application Load Balancer
        Always on (can’t be disabled)
        No charges for inter AZ data
    Network Load Balancer
        Disabled by default
        You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled
