What is load balancing?
    Load Balances are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers (e.g., EC2 instances) downstream


---------------------------------------------
Why use a load balancer? 
    Spread load across multiple downstream instances 
    Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application 
    Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
    Do regular health checks to your instances 
    Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites 
    Enforce stickiness with cookies 
    High availability across zones 
    Separate public traffic from private traffic

---------------------------------------------
Why use an Elastic Load Balancer?
    An Elastic Load Balancer is a managed load balancer
        AWS guarantees that it will be working
        AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
        AWS provides only a few configuration knobs

    It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end

    It is integrated with many AWS offerings / services
        EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS
        AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
        Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator

---------------------------------------------
Health Checks
    Health Checks are crucial for Load Balancers
    They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests
    The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
    If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

---------------------------------------------
Types of load balancer on AWS
    AWS has 4 kinds of managed Load Balancers
    
    1. Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation) – 2009 – CLB
        HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP)
    2. Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) – 2016 – ALB
        HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
    3. Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) – 2017 – NLB
        TCP, TLS (secure TCP), UDP
    4. Gateway Load Balancer – 2020 – GWLB
        Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) – IP Protocol
    
    Overall, it is recommended to use the newer generation load balancers as they provide more features
    
    Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs

---------------------------------------------
Load Balancer Security Groups
    Load Balancer Security Group:
        allow the user/public has the access to Load-Balancer
    Application Security Group: 
        Allow traffic only from Load Balancer
