
-- Whatâ€™s an Auto Scaling Group? -----
    
    In real-life, the load on your websites and application can change
    
    In the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
    
    The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
        Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
        Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
        Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
        Automatically Register new instances to a load balancer

    
-- ASGs have the following attributes ----

    A launch configuration
        # amost the the same info needed to start a instance manually
        AMI + Instance Type
        EC2 User Data
        EBS Volumes
        Security Groups
        SSH Key Pair
    
    Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity
    Network + Subnets Information
    Load Balancer Information
    Scaling Policies
