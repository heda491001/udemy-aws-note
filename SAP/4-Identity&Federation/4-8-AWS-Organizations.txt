# point 
    - top of the Organization, it's the Root OU
    - in Root OU we will have management Account 
        we will use this account for all administration purposes
    - in Root OU we can seviral different OUs
        and each OUs can also have some OUs and Member accounts inside 




====== OrganizationAccountAccessRole ==============

IAM role 
    which grants full administrator permissions 
    in the Member account to the Management account

    * that why Management Account can manage Member account

Used to perform admin tasks in the Member accounts (e.g., creating IAM users)

Could be assumed by IAM users in the Management account

Automatically added to all new Member accounts created with AWS Organizations

Must be created manually if you invite an existing Member account



====== Multi Account Strategies =================

Create accounts 
    per department, per cost center, per dev / test / prod,
    based on regulatory restrictions (using SCP), 
    for better resource isolation (ex: VPC), 
    to have separate per-account service limits, isolated account for logging,

Multi Account vs. One Account Multi VPC

Use tagging standards for billing purposes

Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account

Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account

Strategy to create an account for security
