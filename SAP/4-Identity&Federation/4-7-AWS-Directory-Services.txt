==== What is Microsoft Active Directory (AD)? ====

- Found on any Windows Server with <AD Domain> Services 

- Database of objects: 
    User Accounts, Computers, Printers, File Shares, Security Groups

- Centralized security management, create account, assign permissions

- Objects are organized in <trees>
- A group of <trees> is a <forest>

for example

    we have a <Domain Controller> server ,
    it saved John's account ( such as username and password ) 
    
    so now all of the servers under this <Domain Controller>
    can be access using the John's account 



==== What is ADFS (AD Federation Services)? =======

ADFS provides Single Sign-On across applications

it provide SAML across 3 rd party: 
    AWS Console, Dropbox, Office365, etc...

# so we already see some graph in [4-6] lecture
in short , ADFS is :
    Federation using AD
    ADFS provide a SAML2.0 Assertion
    


==== AWS Directory Services ====

# there are three kind of AD Services provided in AWS

AWS Managed Microsoft AD
    Create your own AD in AWS, manage users locally, supports MFA
    Establish (forests) “trust” connections with your on-premises AD
             auth                         trust                         auth   
    users <-------->  [on-premise AD]  <----------> [AWS Managed AD] <--------> user

AD Connector
    Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on-premises AD, supports MFA
    Users are managed on the on-premises AD
    
    * this future do not contain any Federation Data, it's a proxy

                        proxy                       auth
    [on-premise AD]  <----------> [AD Connector] <--------> user    


Simple AD
    AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
        * using Samba 4 Active Directory Compatible Server 
    Cannot be joined with on-premises AD
    fuctions supports are also limited
        for example, don't have MFA
    but
        it's cheap
                   auth
    [Simple AD] <--------> user 





====== AWS Directory Services AWS Managed Microsoft AD ============

Managed Service: 
    Microsoft AD in your AWS VPC
    * AD Domain Controller (AD DC) will deployed to your VPC
        like a ec2 instances

EC2 Windows Instances:
    Can join the domain and run traditional AD applications (sharepoint, etc)
    Seamlessly Domain Join EC2 Instances from Multiple Accounts & VPCs

Integrations:
    RDS for SQL Server, AWS Workspaces, Quicksight...
    AWS SSO to provide access to 3rd party applications

Standalone repository in AWS or joined to on-premises AD

Multi AZ deployment 
    if enable , AD DC will deployed AD in 2 AZ in you VPC
    if you want more than 2 , 
        you can add more AWS Managed AD 
        and the DC can be increased for scaling

* kind of like RDS , [AWS Managed AD] support
    Automated backups
    Automated Multi-Region replication 



==== AWS Microsoft Managed AD - Integrations =======

# more details about what can be Integrated with our [AWS Managed AD]

Extend On Permise AD
    can create a AD two-way(or one-way) Forest trust
    # see more detail at next Page

AWS Services
    - RDS for SQL Server
    - Amazon Workspaces
    - Amazon Quicksight
    - Amazon Connect
    - Amazon WorkDocs
* and most importently
    - Amazon Single-Sign on(SSO) 
        3rd party IdP can send SAML to AWS-SSO, to get [AWS Managed AD] access

traditional AD applications (deployed on your EC2 instances)
    .NET Apps
    Sharepoint
    SQLServer


===== Connect to on-premises AD ============

Ability to connect your on-premises Active Directory to AWS Managed Microsoft AD

Must establish a Direct Connect (DX) or VPN connection
    * importent

Can setup three kinds of forest

trust:
    One-way trust:
        AWS ----------> on-premises
    One-way trust:
        on-premises --> AWS
    Two-way forest trust:
        AWS <---------> on-premises

Forest trust is different than synchronization
    replication is not supported
    
# the AD on-premise and [AWS Managed] will both the data in their own

# so trusr works like :
    when user try to auth, 
    if AD don't have this user , 
    it will ask the AD is trusted to see if it has this user



======= Solution Architecture: Active Directory Replication =============

# You may want to minimize latency of in case DX or VPN goes down

One Solution is 
    - create a replica of your AD on EC2 in the cloud 
    - Establish trust between the AWS Managed Microsoft AD and EC2

                 replication                                     two-way trust
on-permise AD  ---------------> AD on EC2 Self Managed replica <---------------> AWS Managed AD
                                 



====== AWS Directory Services AD Connector ================

AD Connector 
    is a directory gateway 
    to redirect directory requests 
    to your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory
    
No caching capability

Manage users solely on-premises, no possibility of setting up a trust

VPN or Direct Connect (is needed)

Limits
    Doesn’t work with SQL Server
    doesn’t do seamless joining
    can’tshare directory

how does it work ? 
    1. user  used a credentials onto a Custom Sign-in page ,
    2. this page is connected to [AD Connector]
    3. [AD Connector] will proxy the request all the way to on-permise AD
    4. Send request to STS to AssumeRole
    5. get the <Temproray Security Credentials> to access AWS Services



====== AWS Directory Services - Simple AD ================

Simple AD 
    is an inexpensive Active Directory–compatible service 
    with the common directory features.

Supports 
    joining EC2 instances
    manage users and groups

Does not support 
    MFA, 
    RDS SQL server,
    AWS SSO

Size:
    Small: 500 users, 
    large: 5000 users

Powered by Samba 4, compatible with Microsoft AD

lower cost, low scale, basic AD compatible, or LDAP compatibility

No trust relationship
