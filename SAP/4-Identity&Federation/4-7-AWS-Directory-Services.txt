==== What is Microsoft Active Directory (AD)? ====

- Found on any Windows Server with <AD Domain> Services 

- Database of objects: 
    User Accounts, Computers, Printers, File Shares, Security Groups

- Centralized security management, create account, assign permissions

- Objects are organized in <trees>
- A group of <trees> is a <forest>

for example

    we have a <Domain Controller> server ,
    it saved John's account ( such as username and password ) 
    
    so now all of the servers under this <Domain Controller>
    can be access using the John's account
