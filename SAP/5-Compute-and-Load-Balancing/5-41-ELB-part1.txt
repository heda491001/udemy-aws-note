====Types of load balancer on AWS=====================

AWS has 4 kinds of managed Load Balancers

1. CLB - Classic Load Balancer 
    v1 - old generation - 2009 
    Support 
        HTTP,  HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP)

2. ALB - Application Load Balancer 
    v2 - new generation – 2016
    Support 
        HTTP,  HTTPS, WebSocket

3. NLB - Network Load Balancer 
    v2 - new generation – 2017 
    Support
        TCP,  TLS (secure TCP), UDP

4. GWLB - Gateway Load Balancer 
    (newest) 2020 
    Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) – IP Protocol

Overall, 
    it is recommended to use the newer generation 
    as they provide more features

Some LB can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs



====CLB=====================

Health Checks can be HTTP (L7) or TCP (L4) based including with SSL

Supports only one SSL certificate
  - The SSL certificate can have many SAN (Subject Alternate Name), 
    but the SSL certificate must be changed anytime a SAN is added / edited / removed

  - Better to use ALB with SNI (Server Name Indication) if possible 

  - Can use multiple CLB if you want distinct SSL certificates

TCP => TCP passes all the traffic to the EC2 instance
    Only way to use 2-way SSL authentication



====ALB======================================

Application load balancers is Layer 7 (HTTP)

Load balancing to 
    - multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
    - multiple applications on the same machine 
        ex: containers
        great fit with ECS, has dynamic port mapping

Support 
    HTTP/2 and WebSocket
    redirects 
        (from HTTP to HTTPS at ALB level for example)

Routing Rules for path, headers, query string
