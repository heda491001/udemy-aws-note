==== EC2 Spot Instances ========================================

Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-Demand

Define max spot price and get the instance while current spot price < max
    The hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
    If the current spot price > your max price 
        you can choose to stop or terminate your
        instance with a 2 minutes grace period.

Useage
    batch jobs
    data analysis
    workloads that are resilient to failures.

Not great for critical jobs or databases
    it might be reclaimed by AWS anytime , 
    and you will lose the data on it 


==== Spot Fleets ========================================

Spot Fleets = set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances

The Spot Fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
    Define possible launch pools: 
        instance type (m5.large), OS, Availability Zone
    Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose
    Spot Fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost

Strategies to allocate Spot Instances:
    lowestPrice: 
        from the pool with the lowest price 
        (cost optimization, short workload)
    diversified: 
        distributed across all pools
        (great for availability, long workloads)
    capacityOptimized: 
        pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances

Spot Fleets allow us to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price
