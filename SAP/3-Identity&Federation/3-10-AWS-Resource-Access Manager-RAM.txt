==== Resource Access Manager â€“ VPC example =====

# From an exam perspective 
    one of the most important use case is <RAM> for the VPC.

Each account...
    is responsible for its own resources
    cannot view, modify or delete other resources in other accounts

Network is shared so...
    Anything deployed in the VPC can talk to other resources in the VPC
    Applications are accessed easily  across accounts, using private IP!
    Security groups from other accounts can be referenced for maximum security


So this avoid the needs, for example, to do a VPC pairing.
