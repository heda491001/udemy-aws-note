========== Network Security ===============================

Security Groups
    Attached to ENI 
        Elastic Network Interfaces
        for EC2, RDS, Lambda in VPC, etc
    Are stateful 
        any traffic in is allowed to go out
        any traffic out can go back in
    Can reference by CIDR and security group id
    Supports security group references for VPC peering
    # there is no denied rule , rules are all allowed something
    Default: 
        inbound denied
            # means there is no allowed rule by default
            # so you need add rolls if you want to change 
        outbound all allowed
    
NACL (Network ACL):
    Attached at the subnet level 
    Are stateless 
        (inbound and outbound rules apply for all traffic)
    Can only reference a CIDR range 
        (no hostname)
    Default: 
        allow all inbound, 
        allow all outbound
    New  NACL: 
        denies all inbound, 
        denies all outbound

Host Firewall
    Software based, 
    highly customizable




========== What’s a DDOS Attack? ===============================

DDOS
    Distributed Denial-of-Service


kind of attack to basically shut down an instance 
    by making it cannot accept any new traffic effectively
    And so users cannot access your application anymore.

how it like ?
    
    so you have application server
    
    there is an attacker
        have a bunch of computers that are going to be masters.
            (through some various techniques)
        masters will create lots of bots 
    
    1. all the bots will get into request stuff from our application
    2. so the application server is overwhelmed.and soon there will be a denial of service.
    3. so your normal users cannot access your

    It's very dangerous, but very common on the internet.





========== Type of Attacks on your infrastructure ===============================
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):
    When your service is unavailable because it’s receiving too many requests
    SYN Flood (Layer 4): 
        send too many TCP connection requests
    UDP Reflection (Layer 4): 
        get other servers to send many big UDP requests
    DNS flood attack: 
        overwhelm the DNS so legitimate users can’t find the site
    Slow Loris attack: (Layer 7)
        a lot of HTTP connections are opened and maintained

Application level attacks:
    more complex, more specific (HTTP level)
    Cache bursting strategies: 
        overload the backend database by invalidating cache
    it just depends on the application ,
        and kind of security hole you app may have




========== DDoS Protection on AWS ===============================

AWS Shield Standard: 
    protects against DDoS attack for your website and applications, 
    for all customers at no additional costs

AWS Shield Advanced: 
    24/7 premium DDoS protection

AWS WAF: 
    WAF - web application Firewall
    Filter specific requests based on rules
    # WAF is more against application level protections
    # Base on rules filter can also help you survive a DDoS attack


CloudFront and Route 53:
    # by default , Shield will be enabled
    Availability protection using global edge network
        protect the DDoS , and traffic will never really makes it through to you core app in one region
    Combined with AWS Shield, provides DDoS attack mitigation at the edge

Be ready to scale – leverage AWS Auto Scaling
    so you app will be more flexable , can take more access
    will be more expensive for attacker to DDoS
        which will be also more expensive for you if they attack .....
    anyway , at least it will protect you users' experience from DDoS
      
Separate static resources (S3 / CloudFront) from dynamic ones (EC2 / ALB)

========== AWS Shield ===============================

AWS Shield Standard:
    Free service that is activated for every AWS customer
    Provides protection from attacks such as 
        SYN/UDP Floods, 
        Reflection attacks 
        and other layer 3/layer 4 attacks

AWS Shield Advanced:
    Optional DDoS mitigation service 
        - ($3,000 per month per organization)
    Protect against more sophisticated attack on :
        Amazon EC2, 
        Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), 
        Amazon CloudFront, 
        AWS Global Accelerator, 
        Route 53
    24/7 access to AWS DDoS response team (DRP)
    Protect against higher fees during usage spikes due to DDoS
        # just like we mentioned above 
            if you have your app auto-scale, 
            it may course lots of money while suffering from DDoS attack

         


========== AWS WAF – Web Application Firewall ===============================

Protects your web applications from common web exploits (Layer 7)

Deploy on 
    - Application Load Balancer (localized rules)
    -  API Gateway 
        (rules running at the regional or edge level)
    -  CloudFront 
        (rules globally on edge locations)
        Used to front other solutions: 
            CLB, EC2 instances, custom origins, S3 websites
    - AppSync 
        (protect your GraphQL APIs)

WAF is not for DDoS protection

Define Web ACL (Web Access Control List):
    Rules can include 
        - IP addresses 
        - HTTP headers
        - HTTP body
        - URI strings
    Protects from common attack 
        - SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    Size constraints, Geo match
    Rate-based rules 
        (to count occurrences of events)
    



========== AWS WAF – Managed Rules ===============================

Library of over 190 managed rules

Ready-to-use rules that are managed by AWS and AWS Marketplace Sellers

             ...
    - Use-case Specific Rule Groups

        such as
            - AWSManagedRulesAmazonIpReputationList
            - AWSManagedRulesAnonymousIpList
    - Bot Control Managed Rule Group 
        block and manage requests from bots
