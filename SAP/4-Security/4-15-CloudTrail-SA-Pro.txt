===== Solution Architecture:Delivery to S3 ==========

CloudTrail
    |
    |  Delivery notifications
    |-------------------------> SNS
    |                            |
    |                            |--> SQS
    |                            |--> Lambda
    |
    | Every 5 min
    |------------------> S3
      SSE-S3 (default)    | Lifecycle Policy
      or SSE-KMS          |-----------------> Glacier
                          | S3 Events
                          |------
                                |--> SQS
                                |--> SNS
                                |--> Lambda

S3 Enhancements:
    Enable Versioning
    MFA Delete Protection
    S3 Lifecycle Policy (S3 IA, Glacierâ€¦)
    S3 Object Lock
    SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS encryption
    Feature to perform CloudTrail Log File Integrity validation
        (SHA-256 for hashing and signing)




===== Solution Architecture:Multi Account, Multi Region Logging ==========

Account A   ----|
CloudTrail      |
                |      
Account B   ----|
CloudTrail      |send the log 
                |      
                |----> Security Account
                        S3 + S3 Bucket Policy
                            - cloudtrail-bucket/account-A
                            - cloudtrail-bucket/account-B
                            - cloudtrail-bucket/account-C
                            - .....

                
Observations:
    The S3 bucket policy is necessary for cross-account delivery
    If Account A wants to access its CloudTrail files:
        Option 1: 
            create a cross-account role and assume the role
        Option 2: 
            edit the bucket policy



===== Solution Architecture:Alert for API calls ==========

Log filter metrics can be used to detect a high level of API happening
Ex: Count occurrences of EC2 TerminateInstances API
Ex: Count of API calls per user
Ex: Detect high level of Denied API calls

CloudTrail
    |
    | stream
    |--> CW Logs
            |
            |--> Metric Filters
                    |
                    |--> CW Alarm
                            |
                            |--> SNS



===== Solution Architecture:Organizational Trail ==========

for AWS Organizations
    
    you can create a Organizational Cloudtrail 
        it will audit all the <Member Account> behavior
        it must be created in <Management Account>

    you can create a S3 bucket in <Management Account>
        to store the Organizational cloudtrail's logs 



===== CloudTrail: How to react to events the fastest? ==========

Overall, CloudTrail may take up to 15 minutes to deliver events

CloudWatch Events:
    Can be triggered for any API call in CloudTrail
    The fastest, most reactive way

CloudTrail Delivery in CloudWatch Logs:
    Events are streamed
    Can perform a metric filter to analyze occurrences and detect anomalies

CloudTrail Delivery in S3:
    Events are delivered every 5 minutes
    Possibility of analyzing logs integrity, deliver cross account, long-term storage
