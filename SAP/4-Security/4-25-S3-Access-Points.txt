===== S3 â€“ Access Points ==========
 
# be careful , this is not the vpc endpoint we talked on Before classes 


Each Access Point gets its own DNS and policy to limit who can access it
    A specific IAM user / group
    One policy per Access Point => Easier to manage than complex bucket policies

Can restrict to traffic from a specific VPC

Access points are linked to a specific bucket 
    (unique name per acct/region)
    but can access multiple prefix
