========== Amazon Inspector =============================

• Automated Security Assessments
• For EC2 instances
• Leveraging the AWS System Manager (SSM) agent
• Analyze against unintended network accessibility
• Analyze the running OS against known vulnerabilities
• For Containers push to Amazon ECR
• Assessment of containers as they are pushed
• Reporting & integration with AWS Security Hub
• Send findings to Amazon Event Bridge

========== What does AWS Inspector evaluate? =============================

• Remember: only for EC2 instances and container infrastructure
• Continuous scanning of the infrastructure, only when needed
• Package vulnerabilities (EC2 & ECR) – database of CVE
• Network reachability (EC2)
• A risk score is associated with all vulnerabilities for prioritization
