======== AWS Config =============================

Helps with auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resources

Helps record configurations and changes over time

AWS Config Rules does not prevent actions from happening 
    no deny
    can send a mail to administor using SNS 

Questions that can be solved by AWS Config:
    Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
    Do my buckets have any public access?
    How has my ALB configuration changed over time?

You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes

AWS Config is a per-region service

Can be aggregated across regions and accounts




======== AWS Config Resource =============================

View compliance of a resource over time
    So if some rules apply to that resource then you can see
    it's red when it's not compliant 
    and in as soon as you apply a rule it becomes green and becomes complaint.

View configuration of a resource over time
    You can view the resource configuration over time.
    So you can see when the changes happen and what changes happen.


View CloudTrail API calls if enabled
    in case you have collateral API calls enabled
    you can view who made these changes when the choice happened directly from AWS config.




======== AWS Config Rules =============================

Can use AWS managed config rules 
    (over 75)

Can make custom config rules 
    (must be defined in AWS Lambda)
    Evaluate if each EBS disk is of type gp2
    Evaluate if each EC2 instance is t2.micro

Rules can be evaluated / triggered:
    For each config change
    And / or: at regular time intervals
    Can trigger CloudWatch Events if the rule is non-compliant 
        (and chain with Lambda)

Rules can have auto remediations:
    If a resource is not compliant, you can trigger an auto remediation
    Define the remediation through SSM Automations
    Ex: 
        remediate security group rules, 
        stop instances with non-approved tags
