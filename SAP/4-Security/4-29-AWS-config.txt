======== AWS Config =============================

• Helps with auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resources

• Questions that can be solved by AWS Config:
• Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
• Do my buckets have any public access?
• How has my ALB configuration changed over time?
• You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes
• AWS Config is a per-region service
• Can be aggregated across regions and accounts




======== AWS Config Resource =============================

• View compliance of a resource over time
• View configuration of a resource over time
• View CloudTrail API calls if enabled


======== AWS Config Rules =============================

• Can use AWS managed config rules (over 75)
• Can make custom config rules (must be defined in AWS Lambda)
• Evaluate if each EBS disk is of type gp2
• Evaluate if each EC2 instance is t2.micro
• Rules can be evaluated / triggered:
• For each config change
• And / or: at regular time intervals
• Can trigger CloudWatch Events if the rule is non-compliant (and chain with Lambda)
• Rules can have auto remediations:
• If a resource is not compliant, you can trigger an auto remediation
• Define the remediation through SSM Automations
• Ex: remediate security group rules, stop instances with non-approved tags
