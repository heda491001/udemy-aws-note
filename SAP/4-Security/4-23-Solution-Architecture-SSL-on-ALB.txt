===== SSL on ALB ==========

# ALB integrated with ACM to provide SSL cert

                                AutoScaling group
                             ----------------------   
         https       http       ┌--> ec2 instance
    user -----> ALB ------------+--> ec2 instance
                 |              └--> ec2 instance
                 |                  
            SSL cert from ACM      



===== SSL on web server EC2 instances ==========

user 
  | TCP
  |----> NLB       AutoScaling group        SSM Parameter Store
          |      ----------------------          |
          | HTTPS                                |   
          |------> ec2 instance <----------------|
          |------> ec2 instance <----------------|  (IAM permissions)
          |------> ec2 instance <----------------|
                             Retrieve SSL private key


how it work ?
    make you own web server on ec2 instance
    Retrieve SSL cert from SSM Parameter Store
        you can set this in EC2 boot script
        ec2 instance need to be proper IAM setup
        

but
    performing SSL encryption and decryption can use up
    some valuable CPU resources on your EC2 instances.

    you have to extract the SSL cert out of your SSM Parameter Store,
    which maybe a risk problem if someone can SSH into your EC2 instances.


===== CloudHSM – SSL Offloading ==========

# almost the same as above ,

user 
  | TCP
  |----> NLB       AutoScaling group          CloudHSM <-----> CloudHSM
          |      ----------------------          |             (multi-AZ)
          | HTTPS                                |   
          |<-----> ec2 instance <--------------->|
          |<-----> ec2 instance <--------------->|  
          |<-----> ec2 instance <--------------->|
                                   SSL Offloading


You can offload SSL to CloudHSM (SSL Acceleration)
    CloudHSM will perform SSL Acceleration
    which will save resources for your Web Server ec2 instance

and all the 

Supported by 
    NGINX,
    Apache Web servers 
    IIS for Windows Server

Extra security: 
    the SSL private key never leaves the HSM device

Must setup a cryptographic user (CU) on the CloudHSM device
    and make sure your ec2 instance can use this user 
        for example : 
            you can save the user name and password 
            in SSM Parameter Store
