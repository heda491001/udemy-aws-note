===== CloudHSM ==========

KMS 
    => AWS manages the software & Key for encryption

CloudHSM 
    => AWS provisions encryption hardware

Dedicated Hardware  
    HSM = Hardware Security Module

You manage your own encryption keys entirely 
    (not AWS)

HSM device is 
    tamper resistant, 
    FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance

Supports both symmetric and asymmetric encryption (SSL/TLS keys)

No free tier available

Must use the CloudHSM Client Software

Redshift supports CloudHSM for database encryption and key management

Good option to use with SSE-C encryption
    * very common partten

AWS manages the Hardware
-------------------------
                        SSL Connection
    AWS CloudHSM  <-----------------------------> CloudHSM Client
                        User manages the Keys

# Provided by AWS

    IAM permissions:
        CRUD an HSM Cluster

# Managed yourself

    CloudHSM Software:
        Manage the Keys
        Manage the Users


===== CloudHSM – High Availability ==========

CloudHSM clusters are spread across Multi AZ (HA)

Great for availability and durability
