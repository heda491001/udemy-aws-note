===== AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) ==========

To host public SSL certificates in AWS, you can:
    Buy your own and upload them using the CLI
    Have ACM provision and renew public SSL certificates automatically
        (free of cost)

ACM loads SSL certificates on the following integrations:
    Load Balancers 
        (including the ones created by EB)
    CloudFront distributions
    APIs on API Gateways

who will it work ?

1.        Public www HTTPS Request
    user --------------------------> ELB

2.
    ELB will terminate the request
    which is called SSL termination
    
    this will Less CPU cost in EC2

3.       Provision and Maintain Cert
    ELB <----------------------------> ACM

4.       Private AWS HTTP Request
    ELB --------------------------> server 

SSL certificates is overall a pain to manually manage, 
so ACM is great to leverage in your AWS infrastructure!


===== ACM â€“ Good to know ==========

Possibility of creating public certificates
    Must verify public DNS 
    Must be issued by a trusted public certificate authority (CA)

Possibility of creating private certificates
    For your internal applications
    You create your own private CA
    Your applications must trust your private CA

Certificate renewal:
    - certificates generated provisioned by ACM :
        Automatically done
    - certificates manually uploaded :
        must be manually renewed & re-uploaded

ACM is a regional service
    To use with a global application (multiple ALB for example), 
        you need to issue an SSL certificate 
        in each region where you application is deployed. 
    You cannot copy certs across regions

* But CloudFront is a global servers
    for example , you can set up 
        my CloudFront will use ap-northeast-1 ACM's certificates,
        and it will be fine
