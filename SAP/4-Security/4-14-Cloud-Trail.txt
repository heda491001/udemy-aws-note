===== AWS CloudTrail ==========

- Provides governance, compliance and audit 
  for your AWS Account

- CloudTrail is enabled by default!

- Get an history of events / API calls 
  made within your AWS Account by:
    Console
    SDK
    CLI
    AWS Services

- Can put logs from CloudTrail 
    into CloudWatch Logs 
    or S3

- A trail can be applied 
    to All Regions (default) 
    or a single Region.

* If a resource is deleted in AWS, 
  investigate CloudTrail first!


===== CloudTrail Events ==========

Management Events:
    Operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account    
    Examples:
        Configuring security
            (IAM AttachRolePolicy)
        Configuring rules for routing data 
            (Amazon EC2 CreateSubnet)
        Setting up logging 
            (AWS CloudTrail CreateTrail)
    By default, trails are configured to log management events.
    Can separate by read/write
        Read Events (that don’t modify resources) 
        from Write Events (that may modify resources)

Data Events:
    By default, data events are not logged 
        because high volume operations
    including
        Amazon S3 object-level activity : 
            ex: GetObject, DeleteObject, PutObject
            can separate Read/Write Events
        AWS Lambda function execution activity 
            the Invoke API

CloudTrail Insights Events:
    See next part



===== CloudTrail Insights ==========

※ 
    So when we have so many management events across all types of services
    and so many APS happening very very quickly in your accounts,
    it can be quite difficult to understand what looks odd,
    what looks unusual and what doesn't.
    And so this is where CloudTrail Insights comes in.

Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activity in your account:
    inaccurate resource provisioning
    hitting service limits
    Bursts of AWS IAM actions
    Gaps in periodic maintenance activity

CloudTrail Insights analyzes normal management events to create a baseline

And then continuously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns
    Anomalies appear in the CloudTrail console
    Event is sent to Amazon S3
    An EventBridge event is generated 
        (for automation needs)
        for example : send a mail to administor

===== CloudTrail Events Retention ==========

Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail

To keep events beyond this period, 
    log them to S3 and use Athena
