===== AWS Control Tower ==========


Easy way to set up and govern a secure 
    and 
compliant multi-account AWS environment based on best practices

Benefits:
    Automate the set up of your environment in a few clicks
    Automate ongoing policy management using guardrails
    Detect policy violations and remediate them
    Monitor compliance through an interactive dashboard

AWS Control Tower runs on top of AWS Organizations:
    It automatically sets up AWS Organizations to organize accounts 
    and implement SCPs (Service Control Policies)


===== Account Factory ==========

Automates account provisioning and deployments

Enables you 
    create pre-approved baselines 
    configuration options for AWS accounts in your organization 
        (e.g., VPC default configuration, subnets, region, …)

Uses AWS Service Catalog to provision new AWS accounts


===== Detect and Remediate Policy Violations ==========

so we use a Service called Guardrail
    * [Guardrail] n. 栏杆

Guardrail
    Provides ongoing governance for your Control Tower environment 
        (AWS Accounts)

    Preventive – using SCPs 
        (e.g., Disallow Creation of Access Keys for the Root User)
    
    Detective – using AWS Config 
        (e.g., Detect Whether MFA for the Root User is Enabled)

    Example: 
        identify non-compliant resources 
            (e.g., untagged resources)
            -------------------------            
            - So we have a detective guardrail 
                in control tower 
                which using AWS config  
                and it will monitor for untagged member accounts
            - if it detected a <non-compliant> 
                it will trigger <SNS topic>
            - then <SNS topic> will 
                notify Admin (send mail)
                invoke Lambda to remediate (add tags)
