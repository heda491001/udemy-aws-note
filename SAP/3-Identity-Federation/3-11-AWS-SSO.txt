============= AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) ==================================

• Centrally manage SSO access to:
    • Multiple AWS accounts
    • Commonly used business applications 
        (e.g., Salesforce, Box, Office 365, …)
    • Custom SAML 2.0-based applications

• Integrated with AWS Organizations

• Identity source:
    • SSO-built in: manage users & groups
    • Active Directory through Directory Services
        (AWS Managed Microsoft AD or AD Connector)
    • External Identity Provider: any SAML 2.0 Identity Provider 
        (e.g., Azure AD, Okta Universal Directory)

• Centralized permission management

• Centralized auditing with CloudTrail 
    (e.g., user sign-in activities)

============= SSO vs AssumeRoleWithSAML ==================================


AWS Single Sign-On
    <AWS-SSO> integrated with an identity store
    client sign-into <AWS-SSO> directly
    after verifying, <AWS-SSO>
        will provide credentials 
        and client can access AWS resources

AssumeRoleWithSAML
    client sign-in IdP
    IdP authenticate with Identity Store 
    give a SAML credentials to client
    client send the SAML credentials to <STS> 
    <STS> send back another credentials for AWS
    use the credentials client can access AWS

comparison
    SSO is much more easier to setup 
        since it actually hides a lot of complexity of what happens behind the scenes.
    but because it has to be integrated with the Identity Store
        you need to be the owner of identity provider



============= AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) – With AD ==================================

how it work ?
    set up an integration between <AWS-SSO> and AD
    users sign into the <AWS-SSO> portal
    SSO provide credentials and users can access resources


so how to set up an integration between <AWS-SSO> and AD ?
    
    for AWS Managed Microsoft AD
        very simple config
        * simple AD does not support <AWS-SSO>
    
    if you need to connect with a AD on-permise ,two ways :
    
        1. 
            setup a AWS Managed AD integrated with SSO
            set a 2-way forest trust between AWS Managed AD and On-permise AD 
    
        2. 
            setup a <AD Connector> integrated with SSO
            AD Connector will proxy request to on-premises AD
